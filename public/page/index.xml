      <description>With nearly 8 years of Programming and Automation testing experience, I started out teaching myself programming while working. I have worked at several companies ranging from start-ups to large enterprises focusing on Java and Automation Testing. Throughout my career, I have the opportunity to learn many software development best practices and exposure to several version control systems.
I use this website to document and share everything I learn. My goal is to create concise, easy-to-follow guides for beginner/intermediate automation testing professionals.</description>

      <description>I am planning to provide training for testing professionals with complete knowledge of software testing technologies such as Selenium Web Driver, TestNG, Maven, Java, Selenium Grid, Appium, Performance Testing with Jmeter and Docker. With this automation testing course, you will become adept in test automation and successfully employ the technical knowledge you learn to build a robust testing framework using Page Object Design Pattern and Data-Driven Approach.
The Automation Testing training program kicks off with a detailed overview of Core Java 8 concepts and trains you on automating web applications in Selenium 3.</description>
