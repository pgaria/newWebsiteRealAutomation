      <description>What is an object? Object-oriented languages follow a different programming pattern from structured programming languages like C and COBOL. The Java language is not completely an object-oriented. The structured-programming paradigm is highly data-oriented: You have data structures, and then program instructions act on that data. Object-oriented languages such as the Java language combine data and program instructions into objects.
An object is a self-contained entity that contains attributes and behavior.</description>
