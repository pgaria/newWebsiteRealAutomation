      <description>This post will elaborate more about the simple idea behind page abstraction while using page object model in test automation frameworks.
Abstraction is a technique used in software design that aims to simplify logical entities code representation and allows the software developer to “hide” complex implementations. The goal is to create an abstract (simple) layers which will only expose the most relevant properties and capabilities for the specific entity.</description>

      <description>Sometimes back I wrote an article about running the failed test again using IRetryAnalyzer in TestNG. You can read about How to Retry failed tests in TestNG ?. Retrying the failed Test again creates the problem of having duplicate entries for retried tests in TestNG reports. So when a failed test is being retired and is ends as successful or failed after multiple retry, there are multiple entries in the report with all the retried @Test&amp;rsquo;s considered as Skipped Test and then the final result will looks like the below report.</description>

      <description>Containers allow you to package your application software and all its dependencies together into one process package. Containers can be managed by different versions which allows teams for easy replication of your same application instance across developers/testers or in your cluster.
A container image includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings etc. Containers are lightweight, can work stand-alone and available for both Linux and Windows based apps.</description>

      <description>In past articles, we learned about a simple approach to building scalable Selenium Grid cluster using Docker and selenium images in the virtual machines. But this article is more about building an improved and very easy scalable selenium Grid using an open source project named Selenoid with Docker.
How Selenoid is different from Selenium Grid: The main idea behind Selenoid is to start short-lived container for each Selenium session with a requested browser and stop it immediately when the session is closed from the Test.</description>

      <description>In our last Article, we learned steps to create Selenium Grid using Docker. In our article, we used all the steps from the command line. Now there is a better way to setup Grid using docker-compose file. Using the Docker compose file It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to up and down and scale our grid by just running the File.
#What is Docker-Compose File? Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.</description>

      <description>Integration tests are an integral part of any modern web application, you&amp;rsquo;ll likely be running selenium tests. While Selenium tests are easy to write and execute on your local workstation. Now you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with two options like SaaS provider like SauceLabs and BrowserStack etc. or running your own Selenium Grid on multiple machines and managing a multitude of machines and browser versions. This is going to make you CI process with slow builds.</description>

      <description>In our last article, we talked about basics of running automation Test on Docker. Now, this article is more about debugging the Test running on the containers. It&amp;rsquo;s helpful when you want to see what is happening inside the docker container. In the event you wish to visually see what the browser is doing you will want to run the debug variant of the node or standalone images. A VNC server will run on particular port inside the container with Selenium WebDriver.</description>

      <description>What is Docker? Docker containers allow you to package up an application with all the basic parts to run, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it out as one package.
Developers use Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. Companies use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux and Windows Server.</description>

      <description>TestNG is widely used Test Management Framework these days mostly used with Selenium WebDriver and Unit Testing. This article will try to Run the testNG from simple Java program and try to figure out the architecture of TestNG. We will see what happens in the background when you run your Test.
Running TestNG from Java program: This example creates a TestNG object and runs the @test class TestClass then we will try to add some TestListener int he same Java code.</description>

      <description>In automation Test Suits or running test cases in a bulk suite, we face unexpected Test failure or flaky test caused by network glitch, time-out or some other problem. There is a need for running the failed test cases so that we can get the proper result for the flaky TestCase.
 TestNG provides IRetryAnalyzer interface which can be used to run and configure your retry related logic.
 How to use IRetryAnalyzer: First of all, we should create a class which implements the IRetryAnalyzer interface which has one method public boolean retry(ITestResult result); which needs to be implemented.</description>

      <description>TestNG lets you pass parameters directly to your test methods from the testng.xml file. Passing parameters from the XML file is important when you want to pass configurations like browser name, version,test-URL etc. directly into your Test. Passing these configurations is important because the values are changing and should be always dynamic.
 Passing Dynamic configuration values from testng.xml is important when you want to change parameters like browser or version or operatingSystem etc.</description>

      <description>TestNG allows the tests to run in parallel or multi-threaded mode. Parallel test are helpfull for reduction in test execution time.TestNG use the concept of multi-threading from Java. In the configuration file, the parallel attribute on the  tag us been used for the parallel execution using the testng.xml file. Example:
&amp;lt;suite name=&amp;quot;Suite&amp;quot; parallel=&amp;quot;methods&amp;quot; thread-count=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot; configfailurepolicy=&amp;quot;continue&amp;quot;&amp;gt;  Parallel attribute take multiple values, Below are the valid values:
 parallel= methods : Run all your test methods in separate threads.</description>

      <description>Listeners listen to the event defined in the Test Scripts and behave accordingly. The main purpose of using listeners is to create logs for debugging but we can also manage Listeners for Test Framework Design.
What are TestNG Listeners? In Simple words, they are basically Java classes, which implement some TestNG Interfaces. So that when TestNG raises certain events like Test starting, Test Failure etc. TestNG will look for all Classes which are basically looking for such events and call the respective event handlers.</description>

      <description>There are multiple cases, when we have to validate our use-cases where the logic should be same but the test data is different and we must validate our logic for multiple parameters. TestNG provides a very easy way of passing parameters using the DataProvider. In this article we are going to learn how to use DataProvider with @Test.
 A Data Provider is a method on your class that returns an array of array of objects.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we have steps or tests which are depended on each other and can not be performed alone. For example: To update Facebook account details, User should be logged in already.I personally do not recommend making test cases dependent upon each other and should be independent.
To make dependencies between test, TestNG provides dependsOnMethods or dependsOnGroups attributes which can be used in the @Test. As per the TestNg documentation, there are two types of dependencies:</description>

      <description>In TestNG, we can divide our test cases into multiple classes. Every class can have multiple @test methods.Sometimes Class represents a particular feature and all the test cases are inside the class. So in this article, we are going to learn how we can run multiple tests having multiple classes in TestNG.
Lets make few example test Classes: We will first make few Test Class with multiple @Test. To run all the Classes we should create a testng.</description>

      <guid>https://www.pawangaria.com/post/testng/enable-and-disable-test-in-testng/</guid>
      <description>TestNG provides an attribute for enabling and disable our @Test. There are many times when you don&amp;rsquo;t want to run particular @Test and it&amp;rsquo;s not a better way to remove the whole Test method from the class and then add again if you want to run the @Test again.
 By default all the TestNG @Test methods are Enabled
 How to Enable and Disable @Test: To enable and disable @test, There is an attribute enabled which accepts Boolean type value as True or False.</description>

      <description>Skipping test is also an important concept in TestNG. You can skip the test from running as you don&amp;rsquo;t want to Run the @test and mark the @test as Skip in reports.
To Skip the test we need to use org.testng.SkipException an Exception Class from TestNG. We have to throw an exception to the first line and code will come out from the test. You can have a look at Java document to read more about exception throwing.</description>

      <description>All exceptions are not bad in our product, means we have to test and verify the exceptions in our product. The ExpectedException is a way of verifying that your code throws a specific exception.
 Verifying that code completes normally is important, but making sure the logic behaves as expected in failure and unexpected situations are also important.
 In TestNG, we have an attribute as expectedExceptions which needs to be added to our test where we have to verify the Exception as expected.</description>

      <description>In testing Test is considered successful if it completed without throwing an exception or test successfully validated expected results. Sometimes @test threw an exception that was expected and we mark test as success. TestNG can not just decide what should be the results of the Test by himself, So we need to provide the expected data and expected conditions.
TestNG use the concept of Assert from Java and can be used for adding validation and conditions in your test cases.</description>

      <description>TestNG.xml file is an XML file which contains all the Test configuration and this XML file can be used to run and organize our test. TestNG eclipse plugin can be used to automatically generate testng.xml file so no need to write from scratch. In this article, we are going to learn about what is testng.xml and how to use testng.xml file to run our test.
Create Class with multiple @test methods: First, we need to create a simple class which contains multiple @test methods.</description>

      <description>Before talking about annotations we should talk a little bit about why TestNG is required and what is the need for using any test management frameworks in our test.
All the tests are designed to allow you to quickly verify your application using a very large and diverse set of different data inputs. So test management tools are responsible for managing our test and provide many functionalities or you can say methods we can directly use in Test and no need to write the logic again like comparing two objects, pre-setup for Test, passing a different set of data and many more.</description>

      <description>TestNG is a test management framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit frameworks. TestNG provided and introduced new functionalities and features which make TestNg very powerful and mostly used test management framework in Java programming language. As per the creator of TestNG Mr. Cédric Beust NG stands for next generation.
TestNG can be used in all the phases of testing like Unit testing, integration testing or system testing. TestNG provides better support compare to Junit and other frameworks as the new release and bug fixes are very frequent compared to Junit.</description>

ChromeDriver implements all the standard for the WebDriver which is JSON WireProtocol and communicates based on those protocols. It receives HTTP request and provides HTTP response to the Client. ChromeDriver is not client dependent and separate from the clients like Java, Python, PHP etc. You can use the same ChromeDriver with any of the programming languages as the client.</description>

      <description>What is RemoteWebDriver? RemoteWebDriver in Selenium Webdriver implements each of the JSONWireProtocol commands and maps them into an action that can be performed on a remote machine.
RemoteWebDriver is a Class in the package org.openqa.selenium.remote inside the Client Project of WebDiver. RemoteWebDriver.class implements multiple interface like WebDriver(Yes WebDriver is an Interface not a Class as I have seen many people confused about this information), FindsById, FindsByClassName, FindsByLinkText etc.

      <description>Selenium WebDriver provides cool interface API&amp;rsquo;s to perform many actions on the browser and simulate the user behaviors like the click or enter Text in the TextBoxes. There are many good articles about the WebDriver on the internet but the purpose of this article is to understand what happens in the background when we use actions like click, finding an element or getting title etc. I will be using Java as a programming language in this article.</description>

      <description>Selenium WebDriver provides a programming interface for driving the browser for automation testing. You can find the introduction of WebDriver in my other article. This article is more about the architecture and understanding how selenium WebDriver uses JSON Wire Protocol.
JSON Wire Protocol is an abstract specification of how automation behavior like clicking or typing or whatever you actually want to do with your automation script is mapped to selenium or appium or HTTP requests and response.</description>

      <description>Selenium WebDriver is an open source application for driving browsers for automation testing. Using WebDriver libraries you can drive the browser and perform actions like Click, Open URL, Enter Text, Clear Text, Take Screenshot of browser and many more actions. WebDriver works on a very simple principle of Client Server architecture. The communication between the server and client is through HTTP request and response.
WebDriver uses JSON wire protocol works on RESTful Web Services over HTTP.</description>

      <description>What is TestRail? Gurock TestRail is a modern and very nice tool for the Test Case Management by Quality Assurance and Development Team. TestManagement tools are very helpful for managing the test cases and TestRail is pack with very useful features like web-based application, Rest API integration etc.
Why to use TestManagement Tool with Automation? While making Regression or any kind of Test Automation suit there is a need of maintaining Use cases and maintain the repository which anyone can access and see what use cases are been automated and what is left.</description>
