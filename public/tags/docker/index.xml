      <description>Containers allow you to package your application software and all its dependencies together into one process package. Containers can be managed by different versions which allows teams for easy replication of your same application instance across developers/testers or in your cluster.
A container image includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings etc. Containers are lightweight, can work stand-alone and available for both Linux and Windows based apps.</description>

      <description>In past articles, we learned about a simple approach to building scalable Selenium Grid cluster using Docker and selenium images in the virtual machines. But this article is more about building an improved and very easy scalable selenium Grid using an open source project named Selenoid with Docker.
How Selenoid is different from Selenium Grid: The main idea behind Selenoid is to start short-lived container for each Selenium session with a requested browser and stop it immediately when the session is closed from the Test.</description>

      <description>In our last Article, we learned steps to create Selenium Grid using Docker. In our article, we used all the steps from the command line. Now there is a better way to setup Grid using docker-compose file. Using the Docker compose file It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to up and down and scale our grid by just running the File.
#What is Docker-Compose File? Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.</description>

      <description>Integration tests are an integral part of any modern web application, you&amp;rsquo;ll likely be running selenium tests. While Selenium tests are easy to write and execute on your local workstation. Now you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with two options like SaaS provider like SauceLabs and BrowserStack etc. or running your own Selenium Grid on multiple machines and managing a multitude of machines and browser versions. This is going to make you CI process with slow builds.</description>

      <description>In our last article, we talked about basics of running automation Test on Docker. Now, this article is more about debugging the Test running on the containers. It&amp;rsquo;s helpful when you want to see what is happening inside the docker container. In the event you wish to visually see what the browser is doing you will want to run the debug variant of the node or standalone images. A VNC server will run on particular port inside the container with Selenium WebDriver.</description>

      <description>What is Docker? Docker containers allow you to package up an application with all the basic parts to run, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it out as one package.
Developers use Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when collaborating on code with co-workers. Companies use Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines to ship new features faster, more securely and with confidence for both Linux and Windows Server.</description>
