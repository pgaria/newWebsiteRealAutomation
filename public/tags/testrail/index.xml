      <description>I saw multiple people are struggling to integrate the TestNG Tests with the TestRail and it becomes even more complex when we start using the @DataProvides in TestNG and then update the Results in the TestRail. So I decided to write and create a step by step complete guide with an example of how we can use @DataProvider and normal @Test and update the results using the TestNG Listeners. As we all know the TestRail is a web-based test case management software to store, manage, track &amp;amp; run test cases.</description>

      <description>What is TestRail? Gurock TestRail is a modern and very nice tool for the Test Case Management by Quality Assurance and Development Team. TestManagement tools are very helpful for managing the test cases and TestRail is pack with very useful features like web-based application, Rest API integration etc.
Why to use TestManagement Tool with Automation? While making Regression or any kind of Test Automation suit there is a need of maintaining Use cases and maintain the repository which anyone can access and see what use cases are been automated and what is left.</description>
