      <description>Sometimes back I wrote an article about running the failed test again using IRetryAnalyzer in TestNG. You can read about How to Retry failed tests in TestNG ?. Retrying the failed Test again creates the problem of having duplicate entries for retried tests in TestNG reports. So when a failed test is being retired and is ends as successful or failed after multiple retry, there are multiple entries in the report with all the retried @Test&amp;rsquo;s considered as Skipped Test and then the final result will looks like the below report.</description>

      <description>In automation Test Suits or running test cases in a bulk suite, we face unexpected Test failure or flaky test caused by network glitch, time-out or some other problem. There is a need for running the failed test cases so that we can get the proper result for the flaky TestCase.
 TestNG provides IRetryAnalyzer interface which can be used to run and configure your retry related logic.
 How to use IRetryAnalyzer: First of all, we should create a class which implements the IRetryAnalyzer interface which has one method public boolean retry(ITestResult result); which needs to be implemented.</description>
