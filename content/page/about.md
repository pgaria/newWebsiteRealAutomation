With nearly 8 years of programming and Automation testing experience, I started out teaching myself programming while working. I have worked at several companies ranging from start-ups to large enterprises focusing on Java and Automation Testing. Throughout my career, I have the opportunity to learn many software development best practices and exposure to several version control systems.I have lots of experience in Framework Design and Development.

I am living in Germany with my wife in a beautiful city of [Bamberg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg). In my free time, I like watching movies, traveling to new places and adventure sports.
